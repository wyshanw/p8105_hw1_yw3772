## Probelm 1

**This code chunk creates a data frame consists of numeric, logical,
character and factor vectors.**

``` r
set.seed(12)

df <- tibble(
  x = rnorm(10),
  y = x > 0,
  z = c("red", "red", "red", "red", 
        "blue", "blue", "blue", 
        "yellow", "yellow", "yellow"),
  w = factor(z)
)
```

**Try to take the mean of each variable in the dataframe**

``` r
mean(pull(df,x))
```

    ## [1] -0.4672139

``` r
mean(pull(df,y))
```

    ## [1] 0.2

``` r
mean(pull(df,z))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, z)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(df,w))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, w)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

I can take the mean of variables x and y , which are numeric and logical
vectors. I can not take the mean of variables z and w, because they are
character and factor vectors.

**Below is the code chunk that applies as.numeric function to the
logical, character, and factor variables. Output will not be shown**

``` r
as.numeric(pull(df,y))
as.numeric(pull(df,z))
as.numeric(pull(df,w))
```

Logical and factor vectors are successfully converted to numeric
vectors. Character vector can not be converted to numeric vector.

The failure of taking mean in the above section is because only numeric
and logical vectors can take means. For logical vector, 1 represents
True and 0 represents False.

## Problem 2

**Loading the penguins dataset**

``` r
library(palmerpenguins)
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

**Descriptions of the penguins dataset**

The variable names in this dataset are: species, island,
bill\_length\_mm, bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm, body\_mass\_g,
sex, year.

The table below shows the number of each species in the *species*
variable

    ##    Adelie Chinstrap    Gentoo 
    ##       152        68       124

The table below shows the number of each island type in the *island*
variable

    ##    Biscoe     Dream Torgersen 
    ##       168       124        52

The table below shows the min, 1st quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile,
max value, and number of NA’s of the variable *bill\_length\_mm*

    ##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
    ##   32.10   39.23   44.45   43.92   48.50   59.60       2

The table below shows the min, 1st quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile,
max value, and number of NA’s of the variable *bill\_depth\_mm*

    ##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
    ##   13.10   15.60   17.30   17.15   18.70   21.50       2

The table below shows the min, 1st quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile,
max value, and number of NA’s of the variable *flipper\_length\_mm*

    ##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
    ##   172.0   190.0   197.0   200.9   213.0   231.0       2

The table below shows the min, 1st quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile,
max value, and number of NA’s of the variable *body\_mass\_g*

    ##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
    ##    2700    3550    4050    4202    4750    6300       2

There are 344 rows and 8 columns.

The mean flipper length is 200.9152047

**Scatter plot of flipper\_length\_mm (y) vs bill\_length\_mm (x)**

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color=species)) + geom_point()
```

Save the scatter plot as “hw1\_scatterplot”

``` r
ggsave("hw1_scatterplot.pdf")
```
